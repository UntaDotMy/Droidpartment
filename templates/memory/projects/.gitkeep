# Per-project memories are stored here
# Each project gets its own folder:
#
# projects/
# ├── my-app/
# │   ├── episodic.yaml    # Events in my-app
# │   ├── semantic.yaml    # Knowledge about my-app
# │   └── index.yaml       # Tags for my-app
# ├── another-project/
# │   └── ...
# └── ...
#
# Project folders are auto-created when you work on new projects
# Memories are NEVER mixed between projects
