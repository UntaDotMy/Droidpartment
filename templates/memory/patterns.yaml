# Example (auto-generated after pattern discovery):
# - id: pattern_001
#   timestamp: 2024-12-06T15:00:00
#   pattern: "Database timeouts usually from pool exhaustion, not slow queries"
#   evidence_count: 5                 # Seen in 5 projects
#   projects: ["app-a", "app-b", "app-c", "app-d", "app-e"]
#   tags: [database, timeout, pool]
#   confidence: high                  # High confidence from evidence
