# Example structure (will grow over time):
# database:
#   connection-pool:
#     - "Default pool sizes often too small for production"
#     - "Always implement connection cleanup"
#   timeouts:
#     - "Check pool size before optimizing queries"
#
# api:
#   authentication:
#     - "Token expiry should be checked client-side"
#   rate-limiting:
#     - "Implement exponential backoff for retries"
